First Choice Auto Repair Keller, Tx

# about
this project stemmed from my practicum during my final year of recieving a formal education.
We were instructed to find a job, find an internship, or complete freelance work; I chose the latter.
This site was created from the ground up with the inspiration coming from fireship.io, responsive navbar tutorial.
The php script takes user input from the HTML form and sends email via SMTP using AWS Simple Email Service.
The site is live over at https://firstchoiceautotx.com hosted using AWS lightsail.
The web page is fully responsive and looks mediocre on desktop. We will work towards making it look spectacular in the near future.
